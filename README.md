# Cluster Analysis of Men’s Beach Volleyball Players and Duos

This project contains a poster analyzing men’s beach volleyball
partnerships using a cluster analysis, and includes the code used to
perform the clustering and analysis (inicluding figure creation). The
poster was presented at [the UConn Sports Analytics Symposium 2021
(UCSAS)](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2021/index.html) on October 9th,
2021.

## Using this Repository

The code used to perform the clustering and analysis can be found in
`inst/script`. These files are ordered by numbers, with a brief title
explaining the content of the file as well. Plots created in these files
were saved manually to `inst/poster/img` and the code does not
automatically save the images.

In the `inst/poster` directory, you can find both a powerpoint and pdf
version of the poster. Once again, the `img` directory inside this
folder contains images mostly from the R scripts, although not all were
used in the poster.

Both the original data and intermediate data sets can be found in the
`data` directory. `vb_matches.csv` is the original data which was
downloaded from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/beach-volleyball) in
September of 2021.
